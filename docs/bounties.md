# PayStream Contribution Bounty Program

## Overview

The PayStream Bounty Program provides a structured framework for open-source contributors to contribute to decentralized salary streaming on the Stellar network. Contributors can identify open tasks, submit pull requests, and earn recognition and bounty rewards for merged code.

## Bounty Criteria & Claiming Rules

To claim any bounty in the PayStream repository, every submission must meet the following mandatory conditions:

1. **Pull Request Merged**: The pull request must be reviewed, approved, and merged into the upstream `main` branch.
2. **All Tests Pass**: 
   - `cargo test` passes completely with zero failures.
   - Any new contract function or state modification includes unit tests in `test.rs` covering happy paths and edge cases.
   - Error assertions must test explicit error codes.
3. **Documentation Updated**:
   - Relevant documentation in `docs/` (`docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/bounties.md`, etc.) must reflect changes.
   - Public contract methods must include docstrings documenting parameters, return values, and panic conditions.
   - When public behavior or contract interfaces change, `README.md` must be updated.
4. **Code Quality & Linting**:
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passes without warnings.
   - `cargo fmt --check` passes with zero formatting diffs.
   - Code maintains `#![no_std]` compliance in contract modules.
   - Commits follow Conventional Commits formatting (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`).

## Bounty Tiers & Effort Levels

Tasks in the issue tracker are categorized by effort and complexity:

| Tier | Label | Description | Prerequisites |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter | `good-first-issue`, `small` | Self-contained tasks, documentation additions, query getters, isolated tests | Basic Rust syntax |
| Intermediate | `medium`, `medium-effort` | Storage layout adjustments, event emission, CLI scripts, integration tests | Soroban SDK familiarity |
| Advanced | `high`, `large` | Core state machine logic, token mechanics, fuzzing targets, security mitigations | Deep Soroban and smart contract security knowledge |

## Contribution Workflow

Follow these steps to submit work for a bounty:

```
[1. Select Issue] ──> [2. Signal Intent] ──> [3. Fork & Branch]
         │
         ▼
[4. Implement & Test] ──> [5. Open Draft PR] ──> [6. Review & Merge]
```

### Step 1: Select an Issue
Browse the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/veracindarella/paystream-contracts/issues) tracker. Look for the `good-first-issue` label if you are a first-time contributor.

### Step 2: Signal Intent
Comment on the issue expressing your plan to work on it. Maintainers will confirm assignment to avoid duplicated effort. Work on one active issue at a time.

### Step 3: Fork and Branch
Fork the repository and create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### Step 4: Implement and Test Locally
Ensure all checks pass before opening a PR:
```bash
make fmt-check
make lint
make test
```

### Step 5: Open a Draft Pull Request
Open a Draft PR against `veracindarella/paystream-contracts:main`. Reference the issue number in the PR description (e.g., `Closes #119`).

### Step 6: Review, Merge, and Bounty Fulfillment
Once checks are green, mark the PR "Ready for Review". Address maintainer feedback promptly. Upon merge, the bounty acceptance criteria are fulfilled.
